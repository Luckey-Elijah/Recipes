## 🔢 Steps

> See the bellow for Pico de Gallo (chopped/diced) or salsa (blended in food processor).

### 🔪 Pico de Gallo (No Food Processor)

1. Chop all tomatoes, onions, bell peppers, poblano peppers, and garlic (mince). Combine in mixing bowl.
2. Squeeze the juice of 2 limes (50g of lime juice) into mixing bowl. Mix in until all the parts get to know each other pretty well.
3. Add salt, pepper, and cumin to bowl and mix.
4. Add more poblano peppers if you want more heat in the salsa.
5. Add finely chopped cilantro to taste. I recommend the leafs of 5 to 6 sprigs of cilantro.

### 🍽 Restaurant Style (Food Processor)

> This method is a bit easier in my opinion.

1. Cut tomatoes, onion, and bell pepper into manageable pieces. Add to food processor (but don't turn on yet).
2. Finely mince the garlic and poblano peppers. Add to food processor (but don't turn on yet).
3. Add lime juice.
4. Optionally add cilantro to taste. I recommend the leafs of 5 to 6 sprigs of cilantro. Add to food processor (but don't turn on yet).
5. Combine salt, pepper, and cumin.  Add to food processor (but don't turn on yet).
6. Pulse the food processor until you've reach a sauce-y consistency.
7. Enjoy.
